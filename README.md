This is a working prototype of WarrantyKeeper application, aimed at storing warranty information of products. Since the web-application is not hosted using a dynamic server, only GET requests are handled, whereas all POST/PUT/DELETE requests respond with an error. Reloading the page will also respond with a 404 error.

Use 'user0@gmail.com' and 'password0' to login and access the dashboard.
